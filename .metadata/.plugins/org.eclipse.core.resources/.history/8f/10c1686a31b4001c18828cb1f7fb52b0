/*
Task: Use conditional statements to automate the decision-making process.

What will the application do?
The application prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100.
Display the associated result based on the integer range entered.  

Build Specifications
Use if/else statements to take different actions depending on user input.  
Given an integer entered by a user, perform the following conditional actions:
If the integer entered is odd, print the number entered and “Odd.”
If the integer entered is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 25, print “Even and less than 25.”
If the integer entered is even and in the inclusive range of 26 to 60, print “Even.”
If the integer entered is even and greater than 60, print the number entered and “Even.”
If the integer entered is odd and greater than 60, print the number entered and “Odd and over 60.”

Extra Challenges:
Ask for user information (ex. name) at the beginning of the application, and use it to refer to the user throughout the application.
Add validation to guarantee that a user enters a positive integer between 1 and 100.
